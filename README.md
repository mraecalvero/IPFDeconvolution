# IPF Deconvolution

This repository contains the R markdown files for IPF deconvolution analysis.  


Notes:  

*music_gse134692.Rmd* and *music_gse150910.Rmd* contain the analysis for bulk RNA-seq datasets GSE134692 (first dataset) and GSE150910 (second dataset) respectively.  

*pre-process_scKaminski.Rmd* and *pre-process_scKropski.Rmd* contain the pre-processing for single cell RNA-seq datasets GSE136831 (scKaminski) and GSE135893 (scKropski) respectively. scKaminski is used for deconvolution and scKropski is used for validation.  

*scKaminski_analysis.Rmd* contains further analysis for scKaminski dataset relevant to the deconvolution.  

*validation_scKropski.Rmd* contains the validation analysis.
